# Social Media Content Pipeline

This project uses [PR Pilot](https://www.pr-pilot.ai) to implement a social media content pipeline. From an initial draft, a DEV.to article is generated, which contains the main post. Secondary posts are generated for other platforms and linked back to the original post.

    C -->|Publish| D[Published Post];
    D -->|Distribute| E[Secondary Posts];
    E -->|Link Back| B;
```


## Pipeline Stages

The pipeline has five stages:
- 1️⃣ **Draft** - Drafts are stored as Markdown files in the `drafts` directory.
- 2️⃣ **Generate** - From the draft, a DEV.to blog post is generated.
- 3️⃣ **Review** - The generated post is reviewed and edited before being published.
- 4️⃣ **Publish** - The post is published on the DEV Community platform.
- 5️⃣ **Distribute** - Secondary posts for other platforms are generated, linked to the original post, and published.

## Project Structure

All content is organized in the following structure:
- `drafts/` - Contains all draft content
- `posts/` - Contains all generated posts
- `dist/` - Contains all distributed posts
- `prompts/` - Contains prompts for generating posts
